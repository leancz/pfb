<h1>Jane Paterson Birthday Book</h1>
<p>Jane PATERSON was born 25/12/1845.  She was the sister of my great-grandfather, David who was born in 1840.  Their parents were David Paterson and Eleanor Kirkpatrick.  She kept a ‘birthday book’ that passed into my ownership via my Aunt Nora and my mother.  This is my attempt at transcribing that book.</p>
<p>The illuminated Scripture Text Book: with Descriptive verses, an interleaved diary and coloured illustrations for every day by Edmund Evans.  Published in London by Frederick Warne and Co.”</p>
<p>This hard-backed, green coloured book was used as a ‘birthday book’; it also recorded marriages and deaths.  Against each daily space is the date, a small coloured picture and a tract from the Bible.  A sample page is shown here.</p>
<p><img src="./birthday_book.png" alt="Jane Paterson Birthday Book" width="1266" height="1017" /></p>
<p>This sample covers the month of May from the 22<sup>nd</sup> day to the 27<sup>th</sup> day.  There is only one entry; that is for the 24<sup>th</sup> and shows “James Paterson 1831.  Died January 6<sup>th</sup> 1888” James Paterson was her brother.  As can be seen, the original entry was in pencil and has been overwritten in ink.  Also in pencil, not overwritten can be seen “(57yrs”).</p>
<p>The book is a little fragile; some entries are faded or otherwise difficult to read.  Many entries are in the form of newspaper cuttings.  It is not always clear whether the entry refers to a birth or a death.  I do not know when she started making entries in the book, there are some puzzling dates in the first few pages.  I do not think that all the entries were made by her, looking at the handwriting it would seem that some names etc were actually entered by the person named.  If anyone reading this can help make things a little clearer, please let me know.</p>
<p>My mother, as a child, knew ‘Aunt Jane’.  I think she lived a short distance away.  She thought that Aunt Jane was eccentric; she did not like having to go to her house.  Other local children thought her a ‘witch’. (Jane that is!)</p>
<p>To keep downloading times as short as possible, I will not put any more pictures on this document.  I may copy all entries in the future.  I have tried to keep the punctuation the same as the original but where addresses are shown as several different lines I have, in many cases, done them in a linear form with comma separators.  Before the actual entries start there are a number of introductory pages that have entries of different forms on them.  I shall endeavour to transcribe these first.</p>
<p>Inside the front cover are three newspaper cuttings and two handwritten entries.  These are the details.</p>
<div class="entry">
  <p>Newspaper cutting: "PATERSON - May 4, 1889 at her residence, 28 Womerah-avenue, Darlinghurst, the wife of John Paterson, of a son." Written next to this is the word, "Birth".</p>
</div>
<div class="entry">
	<p>Newspaper cutting “PATERSON – May 29, 1889 at 28 Womerah-avenue, Darlinghurst, Douglas Baird, infant son of John and Mary McLaren Paterson.”  Written next to this is the word, “Death.”</p>
</div>
<div class="entry">

</div>




<p>The next page has, what appears to be, two handwritten entries.</p>
<div class="entry">
  <p>Marriage: Heirs together of the grace of life.  1920.</p>
  <ul>

  and congratulations of her fellow-workers, on the 23<SUp>rd</SUP>
  ulto.  We are glad to know that her marriage will make no difference
  to her church activities.’  Copied from The Parish Magazine 1920.</p>
</div>

<p>Turning the page again, the left hand leaf is headed with the handwritten word “Marriages” and there are two newspaper cuttings.</p>
<div class="entry">
    <p>The first has the handwritten label “1897” and is as follows, “Lishman – Paterson – February 3 at Oxton-road Congregational Church, by the Rev. R.G.Soper, B.A., W. E. Lishman to Edith, eldest daughter of David Paterson, Rock Ferry.”</p>
</div>
<div class="entry">
    <p>The second has the handwritten label “189” (something missing there?) and is as follows.  “Bathgate – Warke – Sept. 11, at Holy Trinity Church, Parliament-street, by the Rev. Richard Postance, M.A., assisted by the Rev. Canon Postance and the Rev.  W.J.Cole, Christopher, eldest son of Mr. Archibald Bathgate, Cressington-park, to Marianne Wilson, only daughter of the late Dr.  Lyle Warke, of 19, Upper Parliament-street.”</p>
</div>

<p>The facing page is headed with the handwritten, “1895 Atties daughter.” And has two newspaper cuttings that apparently refer to the same event.</p>

<div class="entry">
<p>Marriages.
 Dalzell – Kirkpatrick – March 14<sup>th</sup>, at St.
Boniface’s Church, Bunbury, Cheshire, by the Rev. W.A.Edwards,
M.A., Oxon.  William Robert Dalzell, M.A., M.B., C.M. Edin., of 22
Slatey-road, Birkenhead, to Ruth, eldest daughter of Dr. Kirkpatrick
of Bunbury, Cheshire.</p>
</div>
<div class="entry">
<p>MARRIAGE OF DR. DALZELL.  The charming little village of Bunbury, near
Preston Castle, Cheshire, was <em>en fete </em>last Thursday, in
consequence of the wedding of Miss R.M.A.F.G. Kirkpatrick, daughter
of Dr. Kirkpatrick, to Dr. W.R.Dalzell, of Slatey-road, Claughton. 
Dr. Kirkpatrick has lived in the neighbourhood for many years, and
his daughter naturally was well known and highly respected by all
the villagers and residents in the district.  The ceremony took
place in the historic old church at Bunbury, the sacred edifice
being beautifully decorated for the occasion.  Indeed, there were
decorations everywhere, and the road to the church was spanned by
magnificent arches of evergreen.  Everybody attended at the church,
and as the day was beautifully fine, the time was one of general
rejoicings, and everything passed off with <em>&eacute;clat.</em>  The
service was choral throughout.  The Bride (who was given away by her
father) wore a handsome dress of rich ivory white duchesse satin,
trimmed with old lace and finished with orange blossoms.  Her veil
was composed of Brussels net.  She carried a bouquet of white
exotics, and her ornaments were a diamond and sapphire ring, the
gift of the bridegroom; a diamond and ruby butterfly brooch, the
gift of Dr. and Mrs. Blake-Campbell; and gold bracelets, the gift of
Mrs. Aspinall and Mrs. C. Kirkpatrick (sister of the bride), Miss
Poole, Miss Griffiths, and Miss Walker – wore dresses of white
China-silk, made in ‘Liberty’ style.  Mr James Dalzell acted as
best man to his brother.  The ceremony was performed by the Rev.
W.A. Edwards, vicar of Bunbury.  An ‘At home’ was afterwards
given at Birchfield House, the residence of Dr. and Mrs.
Kirkpatrick.  Among the guests present were Dr. Henry Churton,
borough coroner, Dr. Barron, Dr. Blake-Campbell, Dr. Genmell, Dr.
Macpherson, Dr. Westmacott, Mr.A.F.Moore, Mr. and Mrs. F.S.Moore, Mr
W.S.Connacher, Mrs. Miller, Mrs. Walker (Prenton), Mr. And Mrs.
Dyall, &amp;c.  The wedding gifts received were very numerous and
included a handsome silver tea and coffee service from the Liverpool
Association F.C., to which Dr Dalzell has been for some time medical
adviser.  In the afternoon the newly married couple left for their
honeymoon, going first to London and afterwards on the Continent. 
On their return in a fortnight or so they will take up their
residence in Claughton.”</p>
</div>

<p>The next entry is handwritten and puzzling.  Did Jane Paterson spend some time in Moreton-in-Marsh, possibly as a teacher?</p>

<div class="entry">
<p>To Miss P----. Moreton-in-Marsh.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> ‘Until I saw the radiance of thine eyes <br />
Methought no woman had the power to charm –<br />
But since that day I find relief in sighs<br />
And I am filled with sadness and alarm:<br />
<br />
For one so sweet and gentle ne’er should be<br />
Condemned to share a common lot like mine<br />
I could not see thee linked to misery<br />
Joy, peace, and comfort ever should be thine.’<br />
G. Wray 1873<br />
(schoolmaster)<br />

<div class="entry">
<blockquote>
We may write our names in albums,<br />
We may trace them in the sand,<br />
Or may chisel them in marble,<br />
With a firm and skilful hand.<br /><br />
But the pages soon are sullied,<br />
Soon each name will pass away<br />
Soon each monument will crumble,<br />
Like all earthly things decay.<br /><br />
But, dear friends, there is an Album,<br />
Full of leaves of snowy white,<br />
Where no name is ever tarnished,<br />
But for ever pure and bright.<br /><br />
In that Book of Life – God’s Album,<br />
May your name be penned with care,<br />
And may all who here have written,<br />
Write their names for ever there.<br />

<p> “An Oxford correspondent telegraphs that Sir John Stainer died at Verona yesterday.  Sir John was born in 1840, and was professor of music at Oxford.</p>
<p> The deceased musician, who was the son of a Southwark schoolmaster, was also inspector of music to the Educational Department, Whitehall.  He was educated at St. Paul’s Cathedral choir school, Christ Church, St. Edmund Hall, Magdalen College, Oxford.  He was an honorary fellow of Magdalen College, and during his career the degrees of M.A., Mus.Doc.Oxon., D.C.L., and Mus.Doc.Durham, were conferred on him.  At the age of sixteen he became organist to St.  Michael’s College, Tenbury, and three years later, at the early age of nineteen, was made organist at Magdalen College, Oxford.  In 1861 Dr. Stainer had been appointed organist of the University Church, by the then Vice-Chancellor, the Rev. Dr. Jeune, late Bishop of Peterborough, and he held this appointment till 1872, when he succeeded Sir John Goss as organist of St. Paul’s Cathedral, London, which post he resigned early in 1888.  He composed a large number of anthems and Church services, as well as songs of a secular character, and books on harmony and the organ.  He had achieved a high reputation as a scientific musician.  A cantata by Stainer, The Daughter of Caius,’ was composed for and produced at the Worcester Festival, 1878.  In the same year he was nominated by his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales one of the jurors of the Exhibition of Paris, and at the close of it he was appointed a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour.  In 1883 he was appointed inspector of music to the Education Department, and was also nominated by the Prince of Wales member of the Royal College of Music.  In 1888 he received the honour of knighthood, and in 1889 was appointed professor of music in the University of Oxford.”</p>

	<li><p>Newspaper cutting headed “Death of Rev. A. J. Tomlin – Result of an Accident.”  “All Birkenhead will regret to hear of the death of the Rev. Alfred John Tomlin, the aged vicar of St. Luke’s Church, Lower Tranmere.  Mr. Tomlin, who was eighty-three years of age, had been at St. Luke’s for nearly thirty years, and being exceedingly independent, and at time somewhat eccentric, he was well know throughout the borough.  He was educated at Queen’s College, Cambridge, where he took his B.A. degree in 1844, in which year he was ordained deacon at York, and the following year priest at Ripon, and in 1872 he came as curate to Tranmere, prior to which he was curate at Bradford (1844-46), and at Liverpool (1846-72).  In 1883 he was appointed vicar of St. Luke’s, which he held at the time of his death.  In spite of his advanced age, Mr. Tomlin was very active, and took long journeys afoot.  A short ago, while crossing a Liverpool thoroughfare, he was knocked down by a cab, and for a man of his years this was a serious matter.  He recovered from the shock, and was apparently returning to his usual health, but a few days ago he had a relapse, and died on Wednesday, at his residence, Holt Hill, Tranmere.  The funeral takes place at Wallasey Cemetery to-morrow.<p></li>
