My maternal grandfather was Frederick STRIPLING, at least that

was what he was known as.&nbsp; However, he was illegitimate (a fact he was not

aware of until quite late on in his life) and was adopted into the STRIPLING

family.&nbsp; Therefore I am not related to the STRIPLING family, but am very

keen to learn more about them.

My great-grandmother (the mother of Frederick STRIPLING see above) was

Mary Paynter.&nbsp; She was married twice, the first time to a man called SMITH

and secondly, and a little curiously, to William Paynter STRIPLING.&nbsp; In

between those two relationships she gave birth to my grandfather in 1874.

A great great-grandfather.&nbsp; He was the father of Harriett KING who

married Henry BAINES.&nbsp; One of their children, Francis Edgar BAINES was my

grandfather.&nbsp; Samuel was a Londoner and a boot maker, probably born around

1807.

 This is my attempt at transcribing the 'birthday book' kept by Jane Paterson,

born 25/2/1845.&nbsp; Her parents were David Paterson and Eleanor

Kirkpatrick.&nbsp; She married William Rimmer.&nbsp; Most of her life was spent

on Merseyside, UK..&nbsp; Please let me know if you find any mistakes or have

further information to add.
